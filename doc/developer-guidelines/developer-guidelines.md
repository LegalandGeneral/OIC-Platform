# Why developer guidelines?

The insurance market is a heavily regulated industry. While the goal of this platform is to mitigate risks associated to regulation, developers should be aware of practices and considerations. 

# What guidelines? 

There are 3 main areas where regulation (as well as common sense) can impact code: 

* [Accessibility](/doc/developer-guidelines/accessibility/index.md: As many other public serving businesses, assessing that applications are suitable for all audiences, including those with disabilities is key to the quality of Insurance Applications. We provide a few best practices to assist developers when testing their applications. 
* [Data](/doc/developer-guidelines/security/data.md: With GDPR as with any other data regulation policy, handling personal data is a risky business. We aim at providing some guidance around this subject. 
* [Security](/doc/developer-guidelines/security/index.md: This is the most critical of all, especially when combined with data. Security is a vast subject that goes well beyond development of applications. It is always good to have a (necessary incomplete) list of practices and reminders in your back pocket. 

We hope these are useful and welcome any feedback and PRs to get them better!
