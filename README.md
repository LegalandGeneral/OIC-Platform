# Open Industry Cloud Platform
## Introduction

Welcome to the Open Industry Cloud (OIC) project. Our goal is to make public our research to build a sustainable Kubernetes based platform to develop and operate a new breed of InsureTech applications.

## Components

When complete we envision this solution to provide

* Code Hosting
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Deployment Pipelining
* Application Packaging
* Docker Registry
* Orchestration (Kubernetes)
* Logging
* Monitoring
* Service Mesh
* Service Catalog
  * Object Storage
  * KV Store
  * Other Applications (Fraud Analysis, Anomaly Detection...)
* Identity Management
* Serverless functionality
* Billing 

## Quick Start

We use GKE as our experimental infrastructure. Follow our [Quick Start](/doc/quickstart.md) for more information. 

[TBD] If you do not have a Google Cloud account then you can use any distribution of Kubernetes of your liking and use the Helm Charts provided here. See [Deploying with Helm](/doc/deploying-with-helm.md)

## Architecture

The requirements for this project we fairly simple. Everything must be open source with an acceptable licence (MIT or Apache). In addition, individual components must have a commercial support entity available in order to move to production.
